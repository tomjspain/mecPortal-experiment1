  		    <p>
  		    Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are currently 
  		    the current gold-standard for comparing the effectiveness 
  		    of different treatments. In RCTs, patients are randomly 
  		    assigned into groups to receive either an experimental treatment, 
  		    or the control treatment.
  		    RCTs provide high-quality evidence 
  		    which is useful to determine treatment efficacy.

          <p>
          MECs can be used to predict how a patient would perform 
          if treated with the control treatment. This is counterfactual
          evidence generated by a statistical model. 
          This evidence can be compared with the actual 
          performance of patients when treated with the experimental 
          treatment to determine the treatment with greater efficacy.
