        In the case that the outcome is a time-to-event outcome, 
        the observational data
        cohort has an event time variable and a censoring indicator variable 
        (specifying if the event of interest has occured).
        
        The hazard function and a cumulative hazard function are obtained
        Once estimates of the survival function and density function are 
        obtained, then a likelihood can be specified to evaluate survival
        outcomes.
